# Lambdas

- With Java 8 (JDK 1.8), functional programming support was introduced through  
  lambda expressions, giving us more tools to use other than the  
  usual imperative style.

## Imperative vs Functional Style

1. Imperative Programming - also known as procedural programming, it's the most commonly used style. Every detail of the process matters, changing a single step could alter the final outcome. Although fairly intuitive (most of the times), it can be prone to errors and modifications might require rewriting parts of the application.

2. Functional Programming - separate, specialized instructions are provided for each step, which can also be reused in others parts of the applications. This style emphasizes immutability and having no side effects outside of the part you are currently altering. It promotes modularity and testability, although it can often be less intuitive and may require different problem-solving approaches.
